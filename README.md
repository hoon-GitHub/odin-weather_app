### Project Planning
- Project should be mainly about utilizing API's - maybe use `Promise`, `async`/`await`.

### Mid-Project Thoughts/Progress
- `async` function returns a Promise object containing data within it - is there a way to directly access the data from the returned Promise object, without using another `async` function with `await` call, or `.then()`?
- User input error handling?

### Post-Project Remarks
- Learned how to add a 'loading' component while the API fetch call is running (within an `async` function, for the `await` call).
- Also learned how to create a spinner and attach to the button. An object with only the top portion of the rounded border showing, and then make it to spin!
