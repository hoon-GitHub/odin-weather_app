Project assignment page: [Project: Weather App](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app)\
Project started on: **5/17/2024**\
Project finished on: **TBD**

### Project Planning
- Project should be mainly about utilizing API's - maybe use `Promise`, `async`/`await`.
- 

### Mid-Project Thoughts/Progress
- `async` function returns a Promise object containing data within it - is there a way to directly access the data from the returned Promise object, without using another `async` function with `await` call, or `.then()`?
- 

### Post-Project Remarks
